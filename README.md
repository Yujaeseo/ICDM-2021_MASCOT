In recent years, quantization methods have successfully accelerated the training of large DNN models by reducing the level of precision in computing operations (e.g., forward/backward passes) without sacrificing its accuracy. In this work, therefore, we attempt to apply such a quantization idea to the popular Matrix factorization (MF) methods to deal with  the growing scale of models and datasets in recommender systems.
